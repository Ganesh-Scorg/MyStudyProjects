Wissen Interview questions:

1. Design web crowler function. Give the API visit (url) which returns the list of url the page contains.

2. Table has columns Person, Hobbies, find people who don't have hobby as reading.

Select Name, Hobby from Person where Hobby<>'reading'

3. Table A Table B

ID		ID
1.		2.
2.		3.
3.		4.


Output:

ID Present in A   Present in B
1.		yes			No
2.		yes			yes
3.		yes			yes
4.		No			yes

write query for this output.

 select IIF(ISNULL(A.ID,0)=0,'NO','YES') as PresentINA, IIF(ISNULL(B.ID,0)=0,'NO','YES') as PresentINB from A FULL OUTER JOIN B on A.ID=B.ID

4. can constructor be synchronized?

5. How would you handle object creation on event of an exception during constructor execution?

6. Class A exhibit Singleton property, class B extends A, class C extends B. How would you ensure the subclasses also inherit the same property?
Since Singleton class constructor is private, we can't inherit it but if you want then mark it as protected.

7. Class A
	{
		A()
		{
			//some code
			
			J NI
		}
	}
	
	Your task to ensure that J NI invokation doesn't get corrupted due to multiple object being created at the same time.
	Ans: JVM will allow only one thread to call contsructor at a time so there is no problem occure. still if you want we can add synchronize block there.
	
8. You have 2 large datasets of the same nature.

A = 1,4,5...
B = 5,2,9,1000,222

How would you conput rest set A-B? further if the set are sorted, what would your approach be?
for Asymetric diff -> test2.removeAll(test1);

//for Symetric diff -> union minus intersection equals symmetric-difference
Set<Type> symmetricDiff = new HashSet<Type>(set1);
symmetricDiff.addAll(set2);
// symmetricDiff now contains the union
Set<Type> tmp = new HashSet<Type>(set1);
tmp.retainAll(set2);
// tmp now contains the intersection
symmetricDiff.removeAll(tmp);
